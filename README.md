# sql_project

# Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

## Easy Level
1.Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.

2.List all albums along with their respective artists.

3.Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.

4.Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.

5.Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

## Medium Level
1.Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.

2.Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.

3.List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.

4.For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.

## Advanced Level
1.Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.

2.Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.

3.Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
